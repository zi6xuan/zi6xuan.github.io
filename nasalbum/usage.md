## NAS Album

### Questions about use
- The APP currently only supports FTP/FTPS protocol.
- In earlier versions of 1.2.0, when setting the NAS address, you need to create a folder for storing photos in advance, and set full read and write permissions (only backup folders).
- The newer version 1.2.0 already supports browsing FTP directories and supports creating directories for backup.
- If you have any questions, you can contact by mail, I will provide limited support.

### Use Tips
- When family members use it together, you can set the family member's backup folder to the same folder to achieve the purpose of sharing the album content (the App will automatically display the content that only exists on the NAS).
- The newer version 1.2.0 already supports setting multiple FTP connection address management. You can quickly switch to view the backup content of the specified address through the button in the upper left corner of the homepage (only one automatic backup directory is set).

### Description of photo/video status
- If there is no icon, it means that the photos/videos have been successfully backed up to the NAS, and the local album still retains the original files
- ![upload](./outline_upload.png) means the file is being uploaded
- ![cloud](./outline_cloud_done.png) means that the file only exists in the NAS and does not exist in the local album
- ![error](./outline_error_outline.png) indicates that an error occurred during the upload of the file. (you can try to upload again by pulling down the screen)

### Questions about advertising
- In order to provide better service and support, we have adopted two modes of [with ads] and [without ads]. The default mode is with ads. The ad-free mode can be activated through in-app purchases in the settings interface. New users have no full-screen ads within 3 days. After three days, full-screen ads will be displayed when the app is reopened. Here, thank you very much for your recognition of the results of our labor.

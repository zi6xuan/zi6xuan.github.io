## NAS Album

### Usage
- APP currently only supports FTP/FTPS protocol.
- When setting the NAS address, it is necessary to create a folder ready to store photos in advance, and set full read and write permissions (only backup folders).
- If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me via E-mail. I will provide limited support.

### Use tips
- When family members use together, you can set the family member's backup folder to the same folder to achieve the purpose of sharing the album content (the App will automatically display the content that only exists on the NAS).

### About Ads
- In order to provide better service and support, we have adopted two modes, [with ads] and [without ads]. The default mode is with ads. You can activate the ad-free mode through in-app purchases in the settings interface. New users have no full-screen ads within 3 days, and after three days, full-screen ads will only pop up once a day. Here, thank you very much for your recognition of the results of my labor.
